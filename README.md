# Explainable Robot Behavior using LIME and Cozmo

- Record video and actions while manually driving Cozmo to a block
- Combine above training data with pretrained model (resnet) to teach Cozmo to locate block, drive toward it and stop autonomously
- Use LIME to determine which parts of video are relevant to Cozmo's decisions
